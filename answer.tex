\begin{Solution}
Let a_i denote the i'th term of the AP, \(d\) denote the common difference , 
\(s\) denote the sum of first 20 terms 

\section{Given:}
a_4 = 8 , a_6 = 14

\section{To find:}
a_1 \\
\(d\) \\
\(s\)

a_6 - a_4 = 2\(d\) \\
\begin{align*}

d &= \tfrac{a_6 - a_4}{2} \\
  &= \tfrac{6}{2} \\
  &= 3 \\

\end{align*}

a_1 + 3\(d\) = a_4 \\
\begin{align*}

a_1 &= a_4 - 3d  \\
    &= 8 - 3(3) \\
    &= -1 \\
    
\end{align*}
n = 20 \\
\begin{align*}

s &= a_1 + a_2 + ......... + a_{20}\\
  &= \tfrac{n[2a_1 + (n-1)d]}{2} \\
  &= \tfrac{20[2(-1) + (20-1)3] }{2} \\
  &= \tfrac{20[-2 + (19)3]}{2} \\
  &= \tfrac{20*[55]}{2} \\
  &= 550

\end{align*}    
\end{Solution}
