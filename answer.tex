\begin{Solution}
\Large Let $a_i$ \text {  denote the i th term of the AP }, 
 \(d\) \text { denote the common diff, } 
\(s\) \text{denote the sum of first 20 terms} 

\section{Given:}
\Large $a_4 = 8 , a_6 = 14$

\section{To find:}
\Large$ a_1 = ?   d = ?   $ \(s\) = ? \\

\begin{align*}
 a_6 - a_4 &= 2d \\
\LARGE ( i ) d &= \tfrac{a_6 - a_4}{2} \\
  &= \tfrac{6}{2} \\
  &= 3 \\
\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
a_1 &+ 3d = a_4 \\
( ii )a_1 & = a_4 - 3d  \\
    & = 8 - 3(3) \\
    & = -1 
\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
\LARGE        n &= 20 \\ 
        iii)  s &= a_1 + a_2 + ......... + a_{20}\\
               &= \tfrac{n[2a_1 + (n-1)d]}{2} \\
               &= \tfrac{20[2(-1) + (20-1)3] }{2} \\
               &= \tfrac{20[-2 + (19)3]}{2} \\
               &= \tfrac{20*[55]}{2} \\
               &= 550
\end{align*}    
\end{Solution}
